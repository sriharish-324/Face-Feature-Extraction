## Abstract 
The proposed attendance system leverages advanced facial recognition technology to
streamline the attendance tracking process in educational institutions. This system integrates
data collection, feature extraction, and real-time face detection to provide an efficient and
secure solution. The methodology encompasses the creation of a well-labeled dataset with
student faces and metadata, the extraction of unique facial features using OpenCV, and the
storage of these features in a Firebase database with robust authentication. Real-time face
detection is implemented to identify students, and a comparison of features with stored data in
Firebase facilitates attendance recording. The user interface displays pertinent information
about recognized students, enhancing the overall efficiency of the attendance management
process.
